# About [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ARM-software/astc-encoder?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ARM-software/astc-encoder)

This is the official repository for the Arm速 Adaptive Scalable Texture
Compression (ASTC) Encoder, `astcenc`, a command-line tool for compressing
and decompressing images using the ASTC texture compression standard.

## The ASTC format

The ASTC compressed data format, developed by Arm速 and AMD, has been adopted as
an official extension to the Open GL速, OpenGL ES, and Vulkan速 graphics APIs. It
provides a major step forward both in terms of image quality at a given
bitrate, and in terms of the format and bitrate flexibility available to
content creators. This allows more assets to use compression, often at a
reduced bitrate compared to legacy formats, reducing memory bandwidth and
energy consumption.

The ASTC data format specification is available here:

* [Khronos Data Format Specification v1.2 # ASTC](https://www.khronos.org/registry/DataFormat/specs/1.2/dataformat.1.2.html#ASTC)

# Branches

The `master` branch is an active development branch for the next major release
of the compressor; version 2.x. It aims to be a stable branch, but as it is
still under development expect changes to both the command line and the
quality-performance trade offs the compressor is making.

The `1.x` branch is a maintenance branch for the 1.x release series. It is
stable and we will now only land bug fixes for this branch; no new
functionality or performance improvements should be expected.

# Encoder feature support

The encoder supports compression of PNG, TGA and KTX input images into ASTC
format output images. The encoder supports decompression of ASTC input images
into TGA or KTX format output images.

The encoder allows control over the compression time/quality tradeoff with
`exhaustive`, `thorough`, `medium`, `fast`, and `very fast` encoding speeds.

The encoder allows compression time and quality analysis by reporting the
compression time, and the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) between the input
image and the compressed output.

## ASTC format support

The ASTC specification allows three profiles of implementation:

* 2D Low Dynamic Range (LDR profile)
* 2D LDR and High Dynamic Range (HDR profile)
* 2D and 3D, LDR and HDR (Full profile)

The `astcenc` compressor supports generation of images for all three profiles.
In addition it also supports all of the ASTC block sizes and compression
modes, allowing content creators access the full spectrum of quality-to-bitrate
options ranging from 0.89 bits/pixel up to 8 bits/pixel.

# Prebuilt binaries

Prebuilt release build binaries of `astcenc` for 64-bit Linux, macOS, and
Windows are available in the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ARM-software/astc-encoder/releases).
Note that currently no 2.x series pre-built binaries are available.

# Getting started

Open a terminal, change to the appropriate directory for your system, and run
the astcenc encoder program, like this on Linux or Mac OS:

    ./astcenc

... or like this on Windows:

    astcenc

Invoking the tool with no arguments gives an extensive help message, including
usage instructions, and details of all the available command line options.

## Compressing an image

Compress an image using the `-c` option:

    astcenc -c example.png example.astc 6x6 -medium

This compresses `example.png` using the 6x6 block footprint (3.55 bits/pixel)
and a `medium` compression speed, storing the compressed output in the linear
color space to `example.astc`.

## Decompressing an image

Decompress an image using the `-d` option:

    astcenc -d example.astc example.tga

This decompresses `example.astc` storing the decompressed output to
`example.tga`.

## Measuring image quality

Review the compression quality using the `-t` option:

    astcenc -t example.png example.tga

This is equivalent to compressing and then immediately decompressing the
image, allowing a visual inspection of the decompression quality. In addition
this mode also prints out the PSNR quality of the compressed image to the
console.

## Experimenting

Efficient real-time graphics benefits from minimizing compressed texture size,
as it reduces memory bandwidth, saves energy, and can improve texture cache
efficiency. However, like any lossy compression format there will come a point
where the compressed image quality is unacceptable because there are simply
not enough bits to represent the output with the precision needed. We
recommend experimenting with the block footprint to find the optimum balance
between size and quality, as the finely adjustable compression ratio is one of
major strengths of the ASTC format.

The compression speed can be controlled from `-fast`, through `-medium` and
`-thorough`, up to `-exhaustive`. In general, the more time the encoder has to
spend looking for good encodings the better the results, but it does result in
increasingly small improvements for the amount of time required.

There are many other command line options for tuning the encoder parameters
which can be used to fine tune the compression algorithm. See the command line
help message for more details.

# Documentation

The [Effective ASTC Encoding](./Docs/Encoding.md) page looks at some of the
guidelines that should be followed when compressing data using `astcenc`.
It covers:

* How to efficiently encode data with fewer than 4 channels.
* How to efficiently encode normal maps, sRGB data, and HDR data.
* Coding equivalents to other compression formats.

The [Building ASTC Encoder](./Docs/Building.md) page provides instructions on
how to build `astcenc` from the sources in this repository.

The [Testing ASTC Encoder](./Docs/Testing.md) page provides instructions on
how to test any modifications to the source code in this repository.

texture format itself, please raise them in the GitHub issue tracker.
