A ResultSet stores a set of results about the performance of a TestSet. Each
set keeps result Records for each image and block size tested, that store the
PSNR and coding time.

ResultSets are often backed by a CSV file on disk, and a ResultSet can be
compared against a set of reference results created by an earlier test run.
